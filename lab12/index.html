        <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Collaborate with your partner to develop a function that relies on conditional statements.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>Designing exercises and code that build upon previously acquired knowledge while allowing room for experimentation with new concepts is quite manageable for novice programmers. I enjoy this particular exercise because working with the Sorting Hat function brings me joy.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>In my function, I initially formulated a relatively simple conditional statement. Nevertheless, upon further consideration, I recognized that the recurring pattern in its structure suggests a more streamlined approach. Employing key-value pairs would offer a straightforward, effective, and easily correctable solution.</p>
